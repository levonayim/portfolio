                        <p class="body-text">We’ve created this solution for them as their current target market doesn’t see the value in buying into Rosetta Stone’s current subscription model, as many other apps and software such as Duolingo and Buusu, provide a similar learning experience for free. Because of this, their overall revenue has been declining over the last few years, particularly in their consumer revenue.</p></li>

            <p class="body-text">In the current application, the main pain point was that it is locked to the horizontal orientation. It is inconvenient to the users when they are on the go to pull their phone out and needing to rotate it every time.</p>

            <p class="body-text">We decided to design the application so that it can be used both horizontal and/or landscape mode. The experience of the application would not be taken away just because of the orientation. Also, the button size and font size would be the same as well.</p>

            <!-- Our Intervention -->
            <p class="body-text top-of-section"><span style="font-family:proximanova-bold;">Our Intervention:</span></p>

            <p class="body-text">Knowing that for many, the best way to be fully immersed is through travelling to a foreign country, and according to statistics, 53% of those who use a language learning software uses it to communicate better when travelling. Currently, Rosetta Stone has no focus, development, or support on their mobile app around the travel experience, and their competitors, such as Duolingo and TripLingo, have a limited reach. </p>
            <p class="body-text">To add more value to current RS subscribers, we want to bring RS experience to include in-field experiences so that subscribers can really learn the language while immersing themselves in the foreign country. Our solution aims to bring Rosetta Stone closer towards the middle of eLearning and travel where none of their competitors currently exist.</p>

            <!-- Our Intervention -->
            <p class="body-text top-of-section"><span style="font-family:proximanova-bold;">Journey Framework:</span></p>

            <p class="body-text">In order to see how to intervene for our target market, we looked at the journey of our persona who is planning to go on a vacation to foreign country. We considered the touch points and pain points and wanted to intervene between the preparing for the trip, during the trip, and post trip.</p>
            <p class="body-text">We found that there were a lot of pain points surrounding Reinforcement. Rosetta Stone has a lot of lessons that prepare users before their trip. However, it is hard to remember and understand what they have learned unless it is applied in context. Reinforcing the material from the lessons during their trip will help them learn better.</p>

            <img src="img/rosetta-stone/customer-jf.png" alt="bsn-problem" class="rs-problem">

            <p class="body-text"><span style="font-family:proximanova-bold;">Preparing - </span>When Rosetta Stone subscribers plan on travelling, they can use the Rosetta Stone app for lessons related to travelling that are already offered. The app teaches users languages through lessons of various levels and topics in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. However, some pain points are not knowing how to apply what they’ve learned in context and not knowing enough of the language to prepare them for the trip.</p>
            <p class="body-text"><span style="font-family:proximanova-bold;">Communicating - </span> While on their trip, some of the pain points are forgetting what they’ve learned and not knowing enough of the language to communicate. It will be important for them to be able to apply what they’ve learned in context but not have to keep bringing out their phone for language help as that will take away from the experience.</p>
            <p class="body-text"><span style="font-family:proximanova-bold;">Reflecting - </span>The reflecting stage can happen at any time, whether after the trip, or just after a day. Some pain points in the reflecting stage which can include after going out or after the trip is not remembering what they’ve learned, not knowing enough to communicate with friends from the trip, and not knowing which lesson to focus on.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">As the UX designer, I decided it would be the best idea to break the core lessons into different pages. It would be easier for the users to flip back and forth to each lesson instead of scrolling and needing to look at which number they are in. There's also an indicator on the bottom to show the user how many core lessons there are without needing to scroll down just as you would for the current app.</p></li>

                        <p class="body-text">Lastly, we noticed that in the original application, there were 2 icons on the side that we confusing in what they meant. The eye icon on the left meant revealing the answers, while the pause button on the right meant the user can pause and exit the program or skip to another lesson.

The language of the words would change depending on which language the user has chosen for their default known language.</p></li>

They can still use the same functions, such as the saved phrases list, that will help them in a pinch.  However, travelling means immersion, which means fully being in the space. So the first thing we've incorporated is compatibility with a headset or earpiece.  We considered using one that already exists, like Pilot, but we realised that users would have to shell out more for these specialised pieces of hardware that may not be to their liking.  The app will recognised a paired Bluetooth headset or a wired one when plugged into the device while using the translator. The user simply taps a physical trigger on the earpiece and start talking.  Once the audio stream from the user stops, the app stops recording and translates the user’s input, relaying it back to them, just a second later. It allows the user to fully be immersed in the space that they are in without any distractions, and at the same time, provides the reinforcement and support that the user may need.</p>
                        <p class="body-text"><span style="font-family:proximanova-bold">Translator:</span> If users aren't out and about, or don’t have a paired headset, they can use the translator in app as well. They simply tap and hold the record button, speak the phrase or word that they're having difficulty with, let go, and the app will translate it, save it, and speak it back to them. The user had the options of playing it out loud, saving the phrase, and seeing it in both languages.  The screen is divided into two halves: the translator and the past phrases.  Past phrases can be shrunk down to the bottom of the screen, so it’s out of the way.</p></li>

As users may want to practice another language on RS, they can switch languages easily in the account pop-up card. When they switch, they can see a world map that highlights other areas they can travel to that speak the language. This can encourage travelling and further the usage of RS for future trips.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">This project has taught me to be a better designer by thinking of low-on-the-tree ideas that can enhance a user's experience by adding value to a product. I have also learned to work with new tools on the spot by being the only person on the team to have Sketch and Principle. I was also able to play multiple hats and working within a tight schedule by being the UX/UI and Visual Designer. I made sure the UI was designed within brand and being inline with Rosetta Stone's current application. I was also the Interaction Designer by adding the interactions of the app through Principle, making sure each key interaction and element within the application has purpose and was a conscious decision.</p>
                        <p class="body-text">Overall, every week we presented, I was the quality checker to make sure that "OK" was not enough. It needed to be the best in order to present to our class and any guests we had.</p>
